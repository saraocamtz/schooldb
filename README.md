SQLite School Database Manipulation
This Python script connects to an SQLite database containing information about students, courses, grades, and attendance records. It performs advanced data management tasks including:

1. **Filtering**: Identifies students with grades higher than 8 in any course.
2. **Statistics Calculation**: Computes the average grade for each course.
3. **Data Combination**: Merges data from multiple tables to find students with less than 5 attendances in any course.

The script uses SQL queries to manipulate and retrieve data, providing insights into student performance and attendance patterns.
